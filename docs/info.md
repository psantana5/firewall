# Firewall Performance and Troubleshooting

The firewall you're developing performs packet inspection and filtering based on the defined rules. When a packet arrives, it is compared against each rule sequentially from top to bottom. The first rule that matches the packet's conditions determines the action to be taken (allow or block). If no rule matches, the default rule blocks the packet.

It's essential to test your firewall thoroughly to ensure its accuracy and performance. Monitor the firewall's resource utilization and measure its impact on network latency and throughput. Troubleshooting can involve examining log files, analyzing packet captures, and verifying rule configurations. Ensure that your firewall is compatible with the target operating system, network infrastructure, and any other dependencies.
